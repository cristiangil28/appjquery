                        <h1>Breaking Bad</h1>
                        <p>Breaking Bad follows protagonist Walter White, a chemistry teacher who lives in New 
                            Mexico with his wife and teenage son who has cerebral palsy. White is diagnosed with 
                            Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of 
                            fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial 
                            security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power in 
                            this world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from 
                            the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family 
                            man to a kingpin of the drug trade.</p>
